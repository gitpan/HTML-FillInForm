FillInForm now forces hidden fields to have a value.  So <input type="hidden" name="foo">
is transformed to <input type="hidden" name="foo" value=""> if no value is set for 'foo'.

Fixed bug with case-sensitivity and missing checkbox.  Thanks to
Tom Lancaster for this bug report and fix!

Added some test scripts.
