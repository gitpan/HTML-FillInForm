This module automatically inserts data from a previous HTML form into the HTML input and select
tags. It is a subclass of HTML::Parser and uses it to parse the HTML and insert the values into the form
tags.

One useful application is after a user submits an HTML form without filling out required field.
HTML::FillInForm can be used to redisplay the HTML form with all the form elements containing the
submitted info.

Please note that this module requires HTML::Parser 3.26 or greater.

HTML::FillInForm installed by default by several web hosting providers,
including pair.com - see
http://www.pair.com/pair/support/library/serverconfig/perlmods.html

It is also available as a package for some Linux distribution, including Mandrake.
